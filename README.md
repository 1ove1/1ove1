Hello, anyone there???

My name is Andrey Bulavskiy, im a 23 years old PHP developer from Smolensk, Russia.

Write on PHP about 2 years. My stack now is:
* Backend:
  + PHP: 7.1-8.2;
  + Frameworks: laravel (8+) and slim 4;
  + Libraries: PHPUnit, pest, sanctum, inertia;
  + DB: mysql, mariadb, redis (poor);
* Frontend:
  + Frameworks: VueJS (2, 3);
  + Libraries: element-plus, vuex, vue-router, axios;

I use this github for my TREASURES, but the most successful from them:
* GAR BD FIAS parser: https://github.com/1ovve1/gar-address-verification-api;
* Immutable sql builder: https://github.com/1ovve1/query-box;
* Project Zomboid dedicited server manager bot in telegram: https://github.com/1ovve1/project-zomboid-server-docker-telegram-bot.

Ah, yes, im also have a bachelor degree in informatics and computer engineering, but it's kind of unuseful thing i guess. I just use it for my coffee stand.
